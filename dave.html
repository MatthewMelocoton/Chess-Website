    <h1 class="Title">Dave, the Anti-Scholar's Mate Guy</h1>
    <p1 class="paragraph1">Dave, which goes by the name "1L1ebe_6" on Chess.com, is a 473 blitz main rated player and a person who will physically assault you if you  
        play the Scholar's Mate on him. For his openings, he likes to play queen's pawn more than the average person, so it's a little difficult to pinpoint his exact opening.
        He reached a peak blitz rating of 562 elo.
