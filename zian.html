    <h1 class="Title">Zian, Thinks Every Opening is the French</h1>
    <p1 class="paragraph1">Zian, which unfortunately does not have a Chess.com account, is an estimated 200 rated player and is someone who is still quite new to chess.
        He recently learned the French Defense (on accident), but thinks every opening, even on white, is the French.
        He has not really reached any "real" peak elo, but has tried to beat some higher rated players, usually around 500-800 elo.
